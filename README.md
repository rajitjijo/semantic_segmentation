# ðŸš— Carvana Image Masking with U-Net in PyTorch  

This project implements a **custom U-Netâ€“style convolutional neural network** in PyTorch for semantic segmentation, trained on the **Kaggle Carvana Image Masking Challenge** dataset. The model generates precise binary masks of cars from high-resolution images.
